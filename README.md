# Balanced Binary Search Tree in C++

This project demonstrates how to take an **unbalanced Binary Search Tree** and convert it into a **Balanced Binary Search Tree** (BBST) using an inorder traversal and a divide-and-conquer approach.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ BalancedBST.h # Contains struct node and BinarySearchTree class,<br>
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp # Builds an unbalanced BST and balances it

## How It Works
1. Perform inorder traversal of the unbalanced BST â†’ gives sorted array.

2. Recursively choose the middle element as the root to ensure balance.

3. Rebuild the tree from the sorted array.

## correctness
I printed it preorder traversal form due to verify that correct order comes from balanced and unbalanced because inorder will produce same output
